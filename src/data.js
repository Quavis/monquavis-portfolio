      "For the last few years I have been a professional delivery driver but in 2020 I began relearning software development.  Since, I have become certified in Front End Development.  I have used my skills to create personal projects which I have included below.  In addition to my current skill set, I plan to continue expanding by learning 3-D web design using ThreeJs.  When Iâ€™m not coding, I love working out, photography , trying new restaurants , and traveling.   International travel is my favorite but I also enjoy  our local hidden gems ",
